                My Name is Nick Miller professionaly known as ILLENIUM. I Live in Illinois America. One of my notable albums, Ascend, was released in August 2019 on Astralwerks. The album was my first to top the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart and also reached my highest peak on the Billboard 200 at number 14.

                Several of my songs have appeared on the Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart, including two singles in 2019 that peaked at number 3: "Good Things Fall Apart" with Jon Bellion and "Takeaway" with the Chainsmokers (featuring Lennon Stella. I have also worked on numerous notable remixes, including those for the Chainsmokers' "Don't Let Me Down" and Flume's "Say It", the latter of which won the award for "Remix of the Year" at the inaugural Electronic Music Awards in 2017. I was included in the Forbes 30 Under 30 music list in 2020.
